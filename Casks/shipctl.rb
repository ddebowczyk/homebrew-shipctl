  # Shipctl is ad-hoc signed and unnotarized. The ad-hoc signature satisfies the
  # Apple Silicon execution gate; notarization is only consulted for artifacts
  # carrying com.apple.quarantine. Homebrew's cask installer propagates that
  # attribute from the downloaded DMG onto the installed bundle, so Gatekeeper
  # evaluates the app on first launch and rejects it.
  #
  # Removing the attribute before first launch restores the same condition
  # formula-installed tools get for free: their curl download never carries it.
  # `xattr -dr` exits 0 when the attribute is absent, so this is safe to run
  # unconditionally.
